# Focusly: A Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes.

This site offers a collection of relaxing sounds to choose from like rain and thunderstorms which makes the perfect environment to focus and study 🌧️.
With Focusly you can also set your own tasks and goals and get rid of them when finished with a simple click ✔️.
